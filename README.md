# [Kanban_board](https://kanbanboard-vpw9.onrender.com)


## Description

This project implements a Kanban board application with a secure user authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The focus is on providing registered users with a seamless and secure experience for accessing and managing tasks. The application ensures that only authenticated users can interact with the Kanban board and that their sessions are securely maintained.

## Usage
**User Story:**
  ```md
  AS A registered user
  I WANT to authenticate using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
  SO THAT I can securely access and manage my tasks on the Kanban board
  ```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
  ```md
  GIVEN a login page with form inputs for username and password
  WHEN I enter my valid username and password
  THEN I am authenticated using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and redirected to the main Kanban board page
  WHEN I enter an invalid username or password
  THEN I am presented with an error message indicating that the credentials are incorrect
  WHEN I successfully log in
  THEN a JWT is stored securely in the client's local storage for subsequent authenticated requests
  WHEN I log out
  THEN the JWT is removed from the client's local storage and I am redirected to the login page
  WHEN I try to access the Kanban board page without being authenticated
  THEN I am redirected to the login page
  WHEN I remain inactive for a defined period
  THEN my session expires, the JWT is invalidated, and I am redirected to the login page upon my next action
  ```
