# [Kanban_board](https://kanban-board-yxnk.onrender.com)

## Description

This project implements a Kanban board application with a secure user authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The focus is on providing registered users with a seamless and secure experience for accessing and managing tasks. The application ensures that only authenticated users can interact with the Kanban board and that their sessions are securely maintained.

## Usage
## User Story:

```md
AS A registered user
I WANT to authenticate using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
SO THAT I can securely access and manage my tasks on the Kanban board
```

## Acceptance Criteria:

```md
GIVEN a login page with form inputs for username and password
WHEN I enter my valid username and password
THEN I am authenticated using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and redirected to the main Kanban board page
WHEN I enter an invalid username or password
THEN I am presented with an error message indicating that the credentials are incorrect
WHEN I successfully log in
THEN a JWT is stored securely in the client's local storage for subsequent authenticated requests
WHEN I log out
THEN the JWT is removed from the client's local storage and I am redirected to the login page
WHEN I try to access the Kanban board page without being authenticated
THEN I am redirected to the login page
WHEN I remain inactive for a defined period
THEN my session expires, the JWT is invalidated, and I am redirected to the login page upon my next action
```
